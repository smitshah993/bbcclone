    <h2>Who is the flash?</h2>
    <p>Barry Allen is the second character known as Flash. The character first appeared in Showcase #4 (October 1956), created by writer Robert Kanigher and penciler Carmine Infantino. His name combines talk show hosts Barry Gray and Steve Allen. His death in 1985 in Crisis on Infinite Earths removed the character from the regular DC lineup for 23 years. His return to regular comics occurred subsequently in 2008 within the pages of Grant Morrison's Final Crisis and Geoff Johns' The Flash: Rebirth limited series. In 2011, Barry Allen played a key role of the crossover mini-series Flashpoint, which resulted in another reboot of the DC Comics continuity, known as "The New 52". Allen has appeared in various adaptations in other media, John Wesley Shipp played the character in the 1990 CBS television series and Grant Gustin currently plays the character in the 2014 CW television series. He will be played by Ezra Miller in the DC Extended Universe.</p>
